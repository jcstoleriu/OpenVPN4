# OpenVPN fingerprinting 

Group 4 - Leonard Eyer, Cristina Stoleriu, Sofia Lohr, Tobias Loch, Matthijs Reyers

## Docker environments

To generate some datasets with known OpenVPN configurations, we created several docker compose environments contained in the `docker` folder. 
The captured Pcap files are stored in the `docker-pcaps` folder.

Every OpenVPN client container runs the `docker/client.sh` script to generate some network traffic.
